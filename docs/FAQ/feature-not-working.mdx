If none of the features in Celestial are working (no aimbot, no ESP), follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

### Step 1: Check Game Compatibility

Make sure the game is compatible with Celestial. You can also try using Celestial on another game to see if it works.

### Step 2: Check Master Switches

Make sure the master switches for the features you want to use are turned on.

### Step 3: Re-download Celestial

If the first two steps do not solve the issue, try re-downloading Celestial entirely.

### Step 4: Use Your Own Module.dll

If the previous steps do not solve the issue, you can try using your own module.dll. Inject it using Process Hacker or Extreme Injector.
